                My name is Sharad Singh. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from Haldia Institute of Technology. Iâ€™m originally from Vaishali, Bihar.  
                I have a technical background in C++, Data Structures, Algorithms, and various web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. I have completed several projects using these technologies, such as a CodePlay-Hub
                and a GoShopEase-Website. Additionally, I have made contributions to open-source projects.  
                My strengths include strong communication skills, a hardworking nature, and the ability to work well within a team. In my free time, I enjoy playing cricket, listening to music, and watching podcasts.
